# Stop and Take EA

Stop and Take EA is an Expert Advisor designed for Forex trading. It is based on the concept of using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to identify potential trading opportunities. This code is an example provided by Forex Robot Easy Team, and it can be used as a reference to understand the functionality of the Stop and Take EA.

## Input Parameters

- StopLoss: The desired stop loss value in pips.
- TakeProfit: The desired take profit value in pips.
- EmaPeriod: The period for calculating the EMA.
- LotSize: The lot size for trading.

## Initialization
The OnInit() function is responsible for initializing the EA. It sets the stop loss and take profit levels based on the input parameters provided. The NormalizeDouble() function is used to ensure that the stop loss and take profit values are rounded to the correct number of digits.

## OnTick()
The OnTick() function is executed on every tick of the price. It calculates the EMA and checks for potential trading opportunities.

### Calculating EMA
The EMA is calculated using the CopyBuffer() function, which retrieves the EMA values from the previous bars. The EMA values are stored in the EmaBuffer array.

### Checking EMA Trend
The code checks if the EMA is rising or falling by comparing the current EMA value with the previous EMA value for a specific period. If the EMA is rising, the isEmaRising flag is set to true. If the EMA is falling, the isEmaFalling flag is set to true.

### Opening Positions
If the EMA is not rising and the current price is above the EMA, a long position is opened. The stop loss and take profit levels are calculated based on the current price and the input parameters.

If the EMA is not falling and the current price is below the EMA, a short position is opened. Again, the stop loss and take profit levels are calculated based on the current price and the input parameters.

## OnDeinit()
The OnDeinit() function is executed when the EA is deactivated or removed from the chart. It is responsible for closing any open positions before the EA is deactivated.
